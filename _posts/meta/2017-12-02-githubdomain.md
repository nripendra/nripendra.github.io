# Change in domain
Very short notice! My original domain `blogs.nnn.ninja.np` has been down for a while now. I tried communicating with the provider but 
to no avail. So, I have now decided to use `github.io` domain, which is the default domain given by github for any github pages.

To stay safe in future, I plan to continue with this domain on perpetual basis.
