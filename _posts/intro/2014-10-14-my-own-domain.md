Well lets get started with a brief back-story, I have been blogging from [nripendra-newa.blogspot.com](http://nripendra-newa.blogspot.com). Although not very active, I do like to share my ideas every now and then. When I mention url of my blog to my friends and colleagues, they always pick on me about my domain. I'm a techie so obviously I should have my own domain RIGHT :stuck_out_tongue:? This blog is response to all these sarcasm I face from time to time. Now that I have my own super cool domain name [nnn.ninja.np](http://nnn.ninja.np), I decided to use it for my blogs.

### Decissions Decissions

#### Domain name

Well, I'm from Nepal so I thought to take up .np domain, primarily because it is free for Nepalese, all I needed to do was to produce a government verified Identity. Although not the best user interface, our domain Registrar's registration process was quite straight forward.

Our national domain Registrar requires that a personal domain name must include all parts of name as per the citizenship card. Since my full name is "Nripendra Nath Newa" it would become quite a long one if I used my name, so I decided to use just the initials, hence "nnn".

I would have preferred nnn.np as my domain but our registrar required that I had to choose a generic Top Level Domain(gTLD). So, after going through the list of available generic domains I finally settled down for .ninja domain. Mainly because it sounds cool, breaking free from (not so cool) traditional domain names like .com, .net. Also since my domain name already had 3 'n's, both gTLD and ccTLD staring with n was fun, and to some extent I always had this fantasy of becoming a Ninja myself :smile:

#### Blog hosting

When I started registering my domain name, I always planned to host my blog on that domain. But as things progressed I had a second thought. I finally decided to free the main domain in case I may want to host something else there, as you can already notice, this blog is hosted in it's sub-domain [blogs.nnn.ninja.np](http://blogs.nnn.ninja.np). 

I learned about [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for first time from [Phil haack's](http://haacked.com/about/) post titled [Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Haack](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/), and liked the idea very much. I'm a coder and I love coding, I love **git**ing, so github pages seems just the right choice for me to setup a blog. And, most coolest part, this blog is **[open-source](https://github.com/nripendra/nripendra.github.io)**, yeah!!.

#### Arsenal

Well a ninja has to have many handy weapons in their arsenal. Some tools I used for creating this blog includes:

* Git
* Github
* Github for windows
* The very lovely [portable jekyll](https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll) by Madhur Ahuja
* [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
* Modified form of [the-minimum](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/preview/the-minimum/) theme, after being inspired by [Notepad](http://hmfaysal.github.io/Notepad/)
* Shamelessly ripped off [Social Sharing Bar](http://zhangwenli.com/blog/2014/08/03/make-your-own-social-sharing-bar-with-jekyll/).
* Editors
	* Visual Studio
	* Markdown Pad
	* Notepad++

#### Comments section

I believe all blogs must have comments section so that readers have a way for a contextual communication. I have seen [disqus](https://disqus.com/) being used successfully in lots of blogs, so I decided to use [disqus](https://disqus.com/) for the comments section.

#### Analytics

It makes sense to have some information about one's readership, so I decided to sign up for Google analytics.

#### What about old blog?

Well I decided that I would leave my old blog as it is, and move on to this blog. So, all my old posts will still remain there while I'll be posting all my new posts in this blog from now onward.

Most likely the last post in [nripendra-newa.blogspot.com](http://nripendra-newa.blogspot.com) would be a notice pointing to this blog. But I'll do that only when I have some more posts.

### License Overview

As with any open-source project, I think it makes sense to have a license for this blog too. I have decided to host this blog under "Artistic License" license. 

But any code sample posted in this blog will be under **MIT license** unless explicitly mentioned.

### Future

There are some plan in my mind to enhance this blog, mainly some tweaks here and there. I'm also planning to be more frequent with my blog posts, let's see how it goes..
